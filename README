Android screencast wroted in QT. There is one in java? forget it from now on.

 * Support both ICS and JB, Froyo not tested.

Non-feature:

 * Not support multi devices pluged in at the same time.

Pre-requirements
================

 * So that you can get root permission in adb shell
 * adb command is availible in you search path, check it:

   $> which adb
   /usr/bin/adb

 * minigzip installed on your PC (For compressed image transfer)
  
   There is a precompiled x86_64 minigzip binary in the top dir, just copy into
   your system path:

    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   If you want to compile one for yourself, get it from android/external/zlib

    $> cp -rf android/external/zlib zlib-pc
    $> cd zlib-pc
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   You'll be appreciated If you can help to add decompress code in to this
   project to help to avoid runing external program to decompress frame buffer data.
