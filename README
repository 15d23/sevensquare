 * Virtual menu/home/back key on the UI
 * Virtual QWERTY key support
 * Auto connect to your device when plug in
 * Auto turn screen on (wakeup) when connected
 * Auto resize to fit the screen resolution of the device
 * Zoom window as your wish and keep the ratio
 * Click on window to wakeup the device (emulate power key press event)
 * Support both Android ICS and Jelly Bean. Froyo not tested.
 * Support customized 'screencap' for speeding up (RGBA32, RGB888, RGB565)
 * Auto enable compressed data transfer if 'minigzip' found on the host
 * 1~2FPS on MSM8625 device (1.2G dual core, 512M memory, 800x480)
 * Wrote in Qt 4.x, easily port to different desktop environment

Non-feature:

 * Not support multi devices pluged in at the same time.
 * Not support landspace mode (default in portrait mode).
 * Not support screen recording as video
 * Not support screen shot as picture

Pre-requirements
================

Mandatory:

 * Android device in engineer mode (Rooted), So that you can get
   root permission in adb shell

   $> adb root
   $> adb shell id
   uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

 * adb command is availible in your search path, check it:

   $> which adb
   /usr/bin/adb

 * USB cable connected to your android device
 * Qt 4.6+ installed in your system

Optional:

 * minigzip installed on your PC (For compressed image transfer)
  
   There is a precompiled x86_64 minigzip binary in the top dir, just copy into
   your system path:

    $> sudo cp contributes/minigzip /usr/bin

   If you want to compile one for yourself, get it from android/external/zlib

    $> cp -rf android/external/zlib zlib-pc
    $> cd zlib-pc
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   You'll be appreciated If you can help to add decompress code in to this
   project to help to avoid runing external program to decompress frame buffer data.

Compile
=======

 $> apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqtcore4 libqtgui4
 $> make
 $> ./build/seven-square

 Or you can create a short cut on your desktop.

Keypad support
==============

 If you want support more key define in the UI, please read
 the contributes/generate-keymap.sh for more info.

History
=======

'Seven Square' was a game I played when I was a child, and I wrote a QT version
for it. And now it's the base code of this android screen cast tool.
