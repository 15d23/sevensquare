Seven Sqaure
============

Android screencast wroted in QT. There is one in java? forget it from now on.

Features:

 * Click and swipe on the screen (so you can unlock screen by swipe)
 * Virtual menu/home/back key on the UI
 * Auto connect when you plug in new android device
 * Support both ICS and JB, Froyo not tested.

Non-feature:

 * Not support multi devices pluged in at the same time.

Pre-requirements
================

 * Android device in engineer mode
 * So that you can get root permission in adb shell
 * minigzip installed on your PC (For compressed image transfer)
  
   There is an precompiled x86_64 minigzip in the top dir, just copy into
   your system path:

    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   If you want to compile one for your self, get it from android/external/zlib

    $> cp -rf android/external/zlib zlib-pc
    $> cd zlib-pc
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   You'll be appreciated If you can help to add decompress code in to this
   project to help to avoid run using external decompress program for data
   transfer.

 * Qt 4.6+ installed in your system

History

'Seven Square' was a game I played when I was a child, and I wrote a QT version
for it. And now it's the base code of this android screen cast tool.
