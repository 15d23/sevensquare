 * Virtual QWERTY key support
 * Auto connect to your device when plug in
 * Auto turn screen on (wakeup) when connected

 * Zoom window as your wish and keep the ratio
 * Click on window to wakeup the device (emulate power key press event)
 * Support both Android ICS and Jelly Bean. Froyo not tested.

 * Auto enable compressed data transfer if 'minigzip' found on the host
 * 1~2FPS on MSM8625 device (1.2G dual core, 512M memory, 800x480)
 * Wrote in Qt 4.x, easily port to different desktop environment

Non-feature:

 * Not support multi devices pluged in at the same time.

Pre-requirements
================

 * Android device in engineer mode
 * So that you can get root permission in adb shell
 * adb command is availible in you search path, check it:

   $> which adb
   /usr/bin/adb

 * minigzip installed on your PC (For compressed image transfer)
  
   There is a precompiled x86_64 minigzip binary in the top dir, just copy into
   your system path:

    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   If you want to compile one for yourself, get it from android/external/zlib

    $> cp -rf android/external/zlib zlib-pc
    $> cd zlib-pc
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> sudo cp minigzip /usr/bin

   You'll be appreciated If you can help to add decompress code in to this
   project to help to avoid runing external program to decompress frame buffer data.

 * USB cable connected to your android device
 * Qt 4.6+ installed in your system
